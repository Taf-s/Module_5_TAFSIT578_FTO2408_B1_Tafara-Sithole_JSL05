# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator

This is the readme file for Galaxy Playlist Generator

## Description

The purpose of the project was to combine our knowledge of JavaScript arrays and the `map()` function to create a personalized "Awesome Mix" playlist for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. With the task being to filter and organize songs based on each Guardian's musical preference, in order to displaying a playlist tailored just for them.

## Design Choices and Functionality

I used the map() method in order to create a function that would generate the playlist, this function filtered through the songs in order to match the songs and its genre to each of the guardian's prefered genre.
Furthermore, I then dynamically created the playlist by calling the generate playlist function and creating each guardian's playlist.

## Technologies Used

\*Javascript for functionality.
