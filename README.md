# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator

This is the readme file for Galaxy Playlist Generator

## Description

The purpose of the project was to combine our knowledge of JavaScript arrays and the `map()` function to create a personalized "Awesome Mix" playlist for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. The task given was to filter and organize songs based on each Guardian's musical preference, to display a playlist tailored just for them.

## Design Choices and Functionality

I used the map() method to create a function that would generate the playlist, this function filtered through the songs to match the songs and it's genre to each of the guardian's preferred genre.
Furthermore, I then dynamically created the playlist by calling the generate playlist function and creating each guardian's playlist.

## Technologies Used

\*Javascript for functionality.
